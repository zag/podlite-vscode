🔍 **About Podlite:**

Podlite is a lightweight block-based markup language designed for flexibility and ease of use. Its block-oriented structure and lightweight syntax make documentation a breeze, offering expansive capabilities without the complexity.

Podlite is not limited to any specific application domain, programming language, or concept.

In addition, the support for Markdown markup as a standard block adds convenience and allows for the use of familiar syntax for text formatting.
